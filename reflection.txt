## Verification questions

1. Run your `CsvJoin` application with program arguments so that it attempts to join
   `tests/testCsvToList/non-rectangular.csv` (on the left) with `tests/testCsvToList/empty-col.csv`
   (on the right).  What **red text** does your program print to IntelliJ's console?
   (as a reminder, it had better not include a stack trace)

   Answer: TODO

## Reflection questions

1. Which `LinkedSeq` operation did you think was the most difficult to implement and debug?  What
   corner case caught you by surprise or was particularly awkward to handle?  Finally, describe a
   testing scenario that you added which covers this corner case.

   Answer: TODO

2. How did you plan and budget your time so that you could complete and debug your application by
   the deadline?  If you worked as partners, how did you coordinate to ensure in advance that you
   would have sufficient time to work on the project together?

   Answer: TODO
