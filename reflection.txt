## Verification questions

1. Run your `CsvJoin` application with program arguments so that it attempts to join
   `tests/testCsvToList/non-rectangular.csv` (on the left) with `tests/testCsvToList/empty-col.csv`
   (on the right).  What **red text** does your program print to IntelliJ's console?
   (as a reminder, it had better not include a stack trace)

   Answer: Error: Ensure both csv files are in a rectangular format.

## Reflection questions

1. Which `LinkedSeq` operation did you think was the most difficult to implement and debug?  What
   corner case caught you by surprise or was particularly awkward to handle?  Finally, describe a
   testing scenario that you added which covers this corner case.

   Answer: The insertBefore method inserts a new element before a given element (successor).
   It correctly handles the case where successor is the first element in the list by calling
   prepend. I was having trouble with implementing the method with this corner-case in the way.
   I didn't think it was something I had to create a separate if statement for. It was awkward to
   handle because I was unsure on how to add the element, but I later was reminded about prepend.
    list = makeList1();
    list.insertBefore("Michael Jordan", "A");
    assertEquals("Michael Jordan", list.get(0));
    This is the test case we made for the corner case. "A" is at the start of the list.
    "Micheal Jordan" is prepended to the start because of this.

2. How did you plan and budget your time so that you could complete and debug your application by
   the deadline?  If you worked as partners, how did you coordinate to ensure in advance that you
   would have sufficient time to work on the project together?

   Answer: We just planned to start early and submit early in order to avoid having big issues
   near the deadline. The above corner case did take a while, but we had plenty of time to figure
   it out. It was more of a conceptual issue. We met up when we could and tried to tackle the
   large issues together. We dealt with small things on our own and the big hitters together.
